// Rust is an expression-based language
// - Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
// - Expressions evaluate to a resultant value. Letâ€™s look at some examples.
// let y = 10;  // statement
// functions are also statements

// you can not do this in rust
// let x = (let y = 10); // which is equivalent to x = y = 6 which works in other languages

// expressions evalute to a value
// let x = 6; // 6 is an expression to evaluate to 6
// calling a function is an expression, calling a macro is an expression
// a new scope block created with curly braces is an expression
// expression do not end with semicolon, adding semicolon to it turns it into a statement
// which then makes it not to return anything

// to return a value from a function, you must specify the type of the return value and the last
// expression the function block would be returned, you can force an early return by using the word return
// but in most rust programs, the implicit expression return is employed

// Since passing arrays as function argument is quite limiting
// since the array type (element type and length) would limit the arrays
// the function can be applied to, we can instead pass slices to functions
// that expect sequence , and the arrays and vectors would be treated alike
