# Rust Learning Repository

Welcome to my Rust Learning Repository! This repository contains code snippets and exercises that I used while following the official Rust manual. It's a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to learn Rust, from beginners to more advanced users.

## Introduction

Rust is a systems programming language that aims to provide memory safety without sacrificing performance. Known for its strong emphasis on safety, speed, and concurrency, Rust is a great language for both beginners and experienced programmers. This repository documents my journey of learning Rust through the official manual, and I hope it serves as a helpful guide for you as well.
