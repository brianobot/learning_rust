# ðŸ¦€ Rust Learning Repository

Welcome to my Rust Learning Repository! This repository contains code snippets and exercises that I used while following the official Rust manual. It's a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to learn Rust, from beginners to more advanced users.

## Introduction

Rust is a systems programming language that aims to provide memory safety without sacrificing performance. Known for its strong emphasis on safety, speed, and concurrency, Rust is a great language for both beginners and experienced programmers. This repository documents my journey of learning Rust through the official manual, and I hope it serves as a helpful guide for you as well.

### Notice 
```rust
cargo new package_name
```

is equivalent to

```rust
cargo new package_name --bin
```

Since both generate a binary project

In the Cargo.toml file we can specify multiple [[bin]] table to show the different binaries we want 
to generate from the project

##Â TL;DR Survival Guide 
1. Everyone value has an owner in rust
  ```rust
  let s1 = String::from("Brian Obot"); // here s1 one is the owner of the String
  ```
2. there can only be one owner at a time
  ```rust
  let s1 = String::from("Brian Obot");
  let s2 = s1; // here the value has been moved to a new owner s2 and s1 simply becomes inaccessible since 
  // it has not value now, it is snapped out of reality by Rust Thanos (s1 is invalidated )
  ```
  Moving values also applies to function, since passing values to function call is actually the same as moving the 
  value into the variable in the function call signature

  ```rust
  let s2 = String::from("Brian Obot");

  fn print_string(s: String) {
    println!("{}", s);
  }

  print_string(s2); // here the value from the string is moved inot s in the function and s2 is invalidated 
  ```
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value would be dropped
   ```rust
    // external scope 
    // scope refers to the region of code between curly brackets
   {
        // inside the curly braces it's own little scope
        let secret = vec![1, 2, 3, 4].to_bytes();
   } // aat this point, secret is going out of scope and it would be invalidated
   ```

we can use the process of creating reference to values without taking ownership of the value
this can be done with the &<variable_name> syntax, creating reference is called ```borrowing```

### Borrowing Rules
- At any given time you can only have one mutable reference or any number of imutable references
- references must always be valid (the borrow checker uses lifetimes to ensure references are always valid)
  - this ensures that the references lifetime does not outlive the lifetime of the value


###Â Rust Design Patterns

1. Builder's Pattern: The power here is that we can construct objects in an infinite amount of ways
   without much restriction. This is extremely useful when constructing complex objects that require step by step construction
   ```rust
   #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
    struct BurgerBuilder {
        components: Vec<BurgerComponent>
      }

      #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
      enum BurgerComponent {
      BottomBun,
      Patty,
      Tomatoe,
      Cheese,
      Lettuce,
      TopBun,
      }

      impl BurgerBuilder {
        fn new() -> Self {
          BurgerBuilder {
            components: vec![BurgerComponent::BottomBun],
          }
        }

        fn add_component(mut self, component: BurgerComponent) -> BurgerBuilder {
          self.components.push(component);
          self
        }
      }


    fn main() {
        let burger = BurgerBuilder::new()
        .add_component(BurgerComponent::Tomatoe)
        .add_component(BurgerComponent::Lettuce)
        .add_component(BurgerComponent::TopBun);

        println!("Burger: {:?}", burger);
    }
   ```

2. Factory Pattern:
   ```rust
   trait Toy {
        fn log(self);
    }

    struct Robot;
    struct Car;

    impl Toy for Robot {
        fn log(self) {
            println!("The is a toy robot");
        }
    }


    impl Toy for Car {
        fn log(self) {
            println!("The is a toy car");
        }
    }

    enum ToyType {
        Robot,
        Car,
    }


    struct Factory;

    impl Factory {
        fn build_toy(toy_type: ToyType) -> Box<dyn Toy> {
            match toy_type {
                ToyType::Robot => Box::new(Robot),
                ToyType::Car => Box::new(Car),
            }
        }
    }


    fn main() {
        let toy_car = Factory::build_toy(ToyType::Car);
        let toy_robot = Factory::build_toy(ToyType::Robot);
    }   
   ```

3. RAII (Resource Acquisition is Initialization)
  ```rust
  use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

    fn main() {
        let chest = Mutex::<u32>::new(0);

        {
            let key = chest.lock();
            let mut data  = key.unwrap();
            *data += 1;
        }
 
        println!("{chest:?}");
    }
  ```

4. Type
   ```rust
    struct File<State> {
        state: State,
    }

    struct Open;
    struct Closed;


    impl File<Closed> {
        fn open(self) -> File<Open> {
            println!("Opening the file");
            File { state: Open }
        }
    }

    impl File<Open> {
        fn read(&self) {
            println!("Reading the file");
        }

        fn write(&self) {
            println!("writing to the file");
        }

        fn close(self) -> File<Closed> {
            println!("Closing the file");
            File { state: Closed }
        }
    }


    fn main() {
        let closed_file = File { state: Closed };
        let open_file = closed_file.open();
    }
   ```
